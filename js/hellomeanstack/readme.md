# Hello MEAN Stack Development
This hello world brings it all together -- every layer of the MEAN
stack -- into a simple full-stack example.
-   MongoDB
-   ExpressJS
-   AngularJS
-   NodeJS

We highly recommend you first explore the hello worlds focusing on each layer
of the MEAN stack individually before tackling this example that brings
all of the layers together.

In this full-stack example, we will not go step by step through
creating each layer of the example.  The overall example leans heavily on
the individual hello world examples for each layer and we are assuming
that this will make sense after you finish exploring
the individual examples.

## (M) STEP 1: Deploy a MongoDB cluster in the MongoDB Cloud
Please see [hellomongodbcloud](https://github.com/bdmossma/hellogit/tree/master/js/hellomongodbcloud) for a detailed example
of how we set that up and then connect to it and use it.

## (N) STEP 2: Deploy NodeJS in the Google Cloud (App Engine)
STEP 2 is done as part of STEP 3, as Google App Engine in the Google Cloud Platform
deploys both NodeJS and ExpressJS together whenever you deploy an ExpressJS app to
Google App Engine.

Please see [hellonodejs](https://github.com/bdmossma/hellogit/tree/master/js/hellonodejs) for a detailed example
of deploying and using NodesJS on the local machine.


## (E) STEP 3: Deploy an ExpressJS App in the Google Cloud
Please see [hellogooglecloud](https://github.com/bdmossma/hellogit/tree/master/js/hellogooglecloud) for a detailed example
on deploying an ExporessJS app to the

## (N) STEP 4: Deploy AngularJS
In our case, we are not using AngularJS directly, but with the help of the Ionic framework
and specifically Ionic Creator, which is a powerful web-based GUI builder for it
also providing integrated AngularJS scripting support.

Please see [helloangularjs](https://github.com/bdmossma/hellogit/tree/master/js/helloangularjs) for a detail example on using Ionic Creator to
develop an AngularJS application.
