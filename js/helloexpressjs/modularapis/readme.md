
# Hello Modular APIs with ExpressJS

## Local API Aggregation
APIs 1 & 2 are modular APIs residing in the same tier (deployed to
same machine in the network) with app.js which can simply
import and host them.

## Distributed API Aggregation
In addition, app.js can rely upon other APIs that reside elsewhere
in the cloud.  It can create its own APIs by combining other existing
APIs in new and creative ways.
