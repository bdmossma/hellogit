# Hello AngularJS w/ Ionic!
The hello world demonstrates how easy it is to develop an AngularJS application
for the front-end by using Ionic and specifically Ionic Creator.

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is a powerful framework based on [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
which homogenizes function and
look-and-feel for mobile apps and web apps across all of the major
mobile device platforms like iOS and Android.  This means you can have a single
code base but can deploy to any device.

Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_(mobile_app_framework)) for a
Wikipedia overview of the Ionic framework.

[Ionic Creator](http://ionic.io/products/creator) is a web-based IDE created by the Ionic team which provides
a drag-and-drop GUI builder for your AngularJS applications as well as integrated
support for AngularJS scripting.

Ionic Creator currently supports AngularJS (1.x) and has not been updated to
support Angular2, so we will be doing this example on the
back of AngularJS (1.x).  Soon enough, Ionic Creator will be updated to support
the new Angular version and we can tackle learning it then.

## Install Ionic
### For Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS):
`sudo npm install -g ionic`

### For Windows (7, 10):
In Git Bash terminal, run the following command:
`npm install -g ionic`

### Creating an Ionic Application Project
-   Create a free account here and log in: https://creator.ionic.io/app/login
-   TBD

### Running an Ionic Application
Ionic is of course launching the JavaScript components of your Ionic application
on NodeJS on the hood, so you will need install NodeJS
before using Ionic.

#### For Windows (7, 10):
`ionic start myIonicApp`

#### For Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS):
`ionic start myIonicApp`
