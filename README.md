# Hello & Welcome!
This repo is a collection of hello world examples
that are by design incredibly simple but also cover practical topics
that one might work on in the real world.

For the time being, the emphasis is on hello world examples for
each layer of the [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)) stack:
+   M: MongoDB
+   E: ExpressJS
+   A: AngularJS (v2)
+   N: NodeJS
The goal here is to reduce learning curve by dividing and conquering: We are decomposing the larger problem
of learning the MEAN stack into smaller pieces.  We tackle learning one layer at a time, and then
at the end we put all the layers together.

Some popular variants of the MEAN stack are:
+   MEEN stack (AngularJS replaced by EmberJS)
+   MERN stack (AngularJS replaced by ReactJS)

# Getting Started
The MEAN stack is cross-platform, running on Linux, Windows, and macOS.  The foundation of the
MEAN stack is [NodeJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), so it is the first part of
MEAN stack that gets installed.  But before we get started, we recommend installing a
few helpful dev tools.
## Install Development Tools
### Install GitBash (Terminal Emulator)
### Install Atom (IDE)
## Install NodeJS
## Install ExpressJS
## Install MongoDB
## Install AngularJS
