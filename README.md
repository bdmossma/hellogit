# Hello & Welcome!
This repo is a collection of hello world examples
that are by design incredibly simple but also cover practical topics
that one might work on in the real world.

For the time being, the emphasis is on hello world examples for
each layer of the MEAN stack:
+   M: MongoDB
+   E: ExpressJS
+   A: AngularJS (v2)
+   N: NodeJS
